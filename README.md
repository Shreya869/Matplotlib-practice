# Matplotlib-practice
Includes basic plotting, legends, labels, colors, bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, pie chart, subplots, 3-D plotting

It is the practice of visualizing data in graphs, icons, presentations and more. It is most commonly used to translate complex data into digestible insights for a non-technical audience.

This is a great book to use as a starting point if you are new to data visualization — Storytelling with Data

There are thousands of libraries in Python, and Matplotlib is one of the most powerful tools for data visualization in Python.
Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code.

Importing the library
To get matplotlib up and running in our environment, we need to import it.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
It is common practice to import matplotlib under the alias plt — that way, we have to type less code to reference it further down the line.
Whenever you plot with matplotlib, the two main code lines should be,
# Type of graph — this is where you define a bar chart, line chart, etc.
# Show the graph — this is to display the graph

Once you dive deeper into this subject, you can see how much customizability you can have creating colorful, detailed, and vibrant graphs.
There are a lot more graphs available in the matplotlib library as well as other popular libraries available in python, including seaborn, pandas plot, and plotly. It is worth exploring all the different options and finding which library suits your style of coding and analysis.
